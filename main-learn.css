* So we can see by default h1, h2, p ... some element in webpage have space like margins, paddings from default of browser so it might effect to out creating padding and margin process
! Before we set padding and margin we should reset all those margins and paddings by default 
* to do it we will use universal selector to set margin and padding to 0
! we don't use body to get inherited margin:0; and padding:0 why? if we set it, it also have effect but not for text element because margin is not property of text element and there it's not property get inherited from parent element
* use universal selector to set for all single elements and universal selector now is useful for this situation
* and now we can format our page as we wish
